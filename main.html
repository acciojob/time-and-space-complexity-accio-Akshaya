	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the amount of computational time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Analyzing time complexity is crucial for determining the efficiency of algorithms, enabling developers to predict performance and identify the most efficient solution for a given problem. Efficient algorithms with lower time complexity handle larger inputs more effectively, which is essential for optimizing resource use and ensuring scalability in software applications.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another critical aspect of evaluating algorithms, focusing on the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the size of the input data. Understanding space complexity helps developers assess the memory efficiency of their solutions and avoid potential issues related to limited memory resources. For instance, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) indicates that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size. Efficient management of space complexity is particularly important for applications running on devices with constrained memory, ensuring that the algorithm remains feasible and effective.</p>
